- Instructions here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-handle-inputs-and-render-lists

- This was good practice using prop and states in React. Overall I think it was good to see how a task app would be built in React, unlike the one I had already built in vanilla JS.
- 11/14/22 - implemented an edit button for each task. When pressed, the corresponding task element becomes editable and the edit button text changes.
